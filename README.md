==EXPLANATION==

Basically, I was stoked to have a DDR theme that uses dancing characters, REALLY hoping to see the Hottest Party cast join them eventually. I'd pay good money for someone to rip Hop's model for use in Stepmania...

Anyway, I wanted to use Rage's X2 outfit's secondary color, but discovered it had no cut-ins. In fact, none of the "secondary" otufits had cut-ins that featured their colors.

Deciding that wouldn't do, I decided to go ahead and edit the cut-in sprites to use their secondary colors.

It was a long endeavor, and I'm not fully happy with the end results. But for what we have now, this will do.

These edited cut-ins are free to use. I don't even need credits, since all I did was edit color sliders in Photopea. 

Consider these a rough first draft. I plan to improve them all as I go. I hope whover uses these edited cut-ins can vibe with their favorite dancer, in the outfit they chose for them.
