Welcome to Edited DDR Cut-Ins by Faye Scarlet!

A project now indefinitely on hold due to Curliang deleting all his Stepmania themes. Unless a good successor comes along, sadly, this project isn't as high a priority for me anymore.

Refer to releases to download edited cut-ins I've already finished.

Also refer to Enciso0720DDR's DancingSages and Characters, found here: https://github.com/Enciso0720/Enciso0720DDR/tree/main/Characters
(which I hope also doesn't get lost to the void...)

Thanks for stopping by!
